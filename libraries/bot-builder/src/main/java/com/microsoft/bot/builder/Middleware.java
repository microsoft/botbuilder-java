/**
 * Represents middleware that can operate on incoming activities.
 * A {@link BotAdapter} passes incoming activities from the user's
 * channel to the middleware's {@link OnTurn(TurnContext, NextDelegate)}
 * method.
 * <p>You can add middleware objects to your adapter’s middleware collection. The
 * adapter processes and directs incoming activities in through the bot middleware 
 * pipeline to your bot’s logic and then back out again. As each activity flows in 
 * and out of the bot, each piece of middleware can inspect or act upon the activity, 
 * both before and after the bot logic runs.</p>
 * <p>For each activity, the adapter calls middleware in the order in which you 
 * added it.</p>
 *
 * <example>
 * This defines middleware that sends "before" and "after" messages
 * before and after the adapter calls the bot's 
 * {@link Bot.OnTurn(TurnContext)} method.
 * <code>
 * public class SampleMiddleware : Middleware
 * {
 *     public async Task OnTurn(TurnContext context, MiddlewareSet.NextDelegate next)
 *     {
 *         context.SendActivity("before");
 *         await next().ConfigureAwait(false);
 *         context.SendActivity("after");
 *     }
 * }
 * </code>
 * </example>
 * {@linkalso Bot}

     * @param context The context object for this turn.
     * @param next The delegate to call to continue the bot middleware pipeline.
     * @return A task that represents the work queued to execute.
     * Middleware calls the {@code next} delegate to pass control to
     * the next middleware in the pipeline. If middleware doesn’t call the next delegate,
     * the adapter does not call any of the subsequent middleware’s request handlers or the 
     * bot’s receive handler, and the pipeline short circuits.
