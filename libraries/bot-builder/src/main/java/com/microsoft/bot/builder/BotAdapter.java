/**
 * Represents a bot adapter that can connect a bot to a service endpoint.
 * This class is abstract.
 * The bot adapter encapsulates authentication processes and sends
 * activities to and receives activities from the Bot Connector Service. When your
 * bot receives an activity, the adapter creates a context object, passes it to your
 * bot's application logic, and sends responses back to the user's channel.
 * <p>Use {@link Use(Middleware)} to add {@link Middleware} objects
 * to your adapter’s middleware collection. The adapter processes and directs
 * incoming activities in through the bot middleware pipeline to your bot’s logic
 * and then back out again. As each activity flows in and out of the bot, each piece
 * of middleware can inspect or act upon the activity, both before and after the bot
 * logic runs.</p>
