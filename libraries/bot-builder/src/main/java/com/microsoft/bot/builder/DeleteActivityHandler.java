 * A method that can participate in delete activity events for the current turn.

 * @return A task that represents the work queued to execute.
 * A handler calls the {@code next} delegate to pass control to
 * the next registered handler. If a handler doesnâ€™t call the next delegate,
 * the adapter does not call any of the subsequent handlers and does not delete the
 *activity.
 * <p>The conversation reference's {@link ConversationReference.ActivityId}
