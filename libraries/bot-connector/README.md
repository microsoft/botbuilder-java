# Microsoft Bot Framework Connector for Java

Within the Bot Framework, the Bot Connector service enables your bot to exchange messages with users on channels that are configured in the Bot Framework Portal.

## How to Install
Add to maven dependencies

````
  <dependency>
      <groupId>com.microsoft.bot.connector</groupId>
      <artifactId>bot-connector</artifactId>
      <version>VERSION</version>
  </dependency>
````

## How to Use

### Authentication
Your bot communicates with the Bot Connector service using HTTP over a secured channel (SSL/TLS). When your bot sends a request to the Connector service, it must include information that the Connector service can use to verify its identity.

To authenticate the requests, you'll need configure the Connector with the App ID and password that you obtained for your bot during registration and the Connector will handle the rest.

### Example
Client creation (with authentication), conversation initialization and activity send to user.

 ```java
  String appId = "<your-app-id>";
  String appPassword = "<your-app-password>";
  
  MicrosoftAppCredentials credentials = new MicrosoftAppCredentials(appId, appPassword);
  
  ConnectorClientImpl client = new ConnectorClientImpl("https://slack.botframework.com", credentials);
  
  ChannelAccount bot = new ChannelAccount().withId("<bot-id>");
  ChannelAccount user = new ChannelAccount().withId("<user-id>");

  ConversationParameters conversation = new ConversationParameters()
        .withBot(bot)
        .withMembers(Collections.singletonList(user))
        .withIsGroup(false);

  ConversationResourceResponse result = client.conversations().createConversation(conversation);
        
  Activity activity = new Activity()
        .withType(ActivityTypes.MESSAGE)
        .withFrom(bot)
        .withRecipient(user)
        .withText("this a message from Bot Connector Client (Java)");

  ResourceResponse response = client.conversations().sendToConversation(result.id(), activity);
 ```
 
 ### Simple EchoBot Example ([source code](../../samples/bot-connector-sample))
EchoBot is a minimal bot that receives message activities and replies with the same content.
The sample shows how to use HTTPServer for listening to activities and the ConnectorClient for sending activities.
